</p> 

* **Data Diagnostics**: DataLab allows for analysis and understanding of data to uncover undesirable traits such as hate speech, gender bias, or label imbalance.
* **Operation Standardization**: DataLab provides and standardizes a large number of data processing operations, including aggregating, preprocessing, featurizing, editing and prompting operations.
* **Data Search**: DataLab provides a semantic dataset search tool to help identify appropriate datasets given a textual description of an idea.
* **Global Analysis**: DataLab provides tools to perform global analyses over a variety of datasets.



## Installation
DataLab can be installed from PyPi
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install datalabs
```
or from the source
```bash
# This is suitable for SDK developers
pip install --upgrade pip
git clone git@github.com:ExpressAI/DataLab.git
cd Datalab
pip install .
```

## Getting started
Here we give several examples to showcase the usage of DataLab. For more information, please refer to the corresponding sections in our [documentation](https://expressai.github.io/DataLab/).





```python
# pip install datalabs
from datalabs import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("ag_news")


# Preprocessing operation
from preprocess import *
res=dataset["test"].apply(lower)
print(next(res))

# Featurizing operation
from featurize import *
res = dataset["test"].apply(get_text_length) # get length
print(next(res))

res = dataset["test"].apply(get_entities_spacy) # get entity
print(next(res))

# Editing/Transformation operation
from edit import *
res = dataset["test"].apply(change_person_name) #  change person name
print(next(res))

# Prompting operation
from prompt import *
res = dataset["test"].apply(template_tc1)
print(next(res))

# Aggregating operation
from aggregate.text_classification import *
res = dataset["test"].apply(get_statistics)
```
 

## Acknowledgment
DataLab originated from a fork of the awesome [Huggingface Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and [TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets). We highly thank the Huggingface/TensorFlow Datasets for building this amazing library. More details on the differences between DataLab and them can be found in the section
