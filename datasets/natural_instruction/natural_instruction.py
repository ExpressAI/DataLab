_DESCRIPTION = """\
This is a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and
their expert-written instructions. It covers 76 distinct task types, including but
not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence tagging, text rewriting, and text
composition. This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of
cross-task generalization under instructionsâ€”training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones
