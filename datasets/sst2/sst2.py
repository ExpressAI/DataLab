_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a corpus with fully labeled parse trees that allows 
for a complete analysis of the compositional effects of sentiment in language. The corpus 
is based on the dataset introduced by Pang and Lee (2005) and consists of 11,855 single 
sentences extracted from movie reviews. It was parsed with the Stanford parser and includes 
a total of 215,154 unique phrases from those parse trees, each annotated by 3 human judges.
SST-2 is the binary version of SST. For more information, please refer to the link
