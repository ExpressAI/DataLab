XQuAD (Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset) is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-lingual question answering
performance. The dataset consists of a subset of 240 paragraphs and 1190 question-answer pairs from the development set
of SQuAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) together with their professional translations into ten languages: Spanish, German,
Greek, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and Romanian. Consequently, the dataset is entirely parallel
across 12 languages.
